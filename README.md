# Decision-Tree-Visualization-using-dtreeviz
# Description 
### *dtreeviz is a Python library that helps you visualize decision trees. It is a wrapper around the popular Graphviz library, and it provides a number of features that make it easy to create beautiful and informative decision tree visualizations.*

### *dtreeviz can be used to visualize decision trees from a variety of machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, pytorch, and tensorflow. It also supports a number of different visualization options, including:*

### **. Feature importance: dtreeviz can show you the importance of each feature in the decision tree.**
### **. Decision boundaries: dtreeviz can show you the decision boundaries of the decision tree.**
### **. Leaf node distributions: dtreeviz can show you the distribution of data points in each leaf node.**
### **. Partial dependence plots: dtreeviz can show you the partial dependence of each feature on the predicted class.**

### **Currently dtreeviz supports: scikit-learn, XGBoost, Spark MLlib, LightGBM, and Tensorflow.**

# **See Installation instructions**
# **Installation** 
### You might verify that you do not have installed graphviz-related packages installed because dtreeviz needs the pip versions, you can follow these steps:
### **For windows**
### To install dtreeviz(version>=2.2.1), do this for windows, max, linux. 
#### **pip install dtreeviz** 
### Check the dtreeviz version 
### **dtreeviz --version**
### **After dtreeviz installation make sure to pip install graphviz, which is common to all platforms.**
# **Graphviz**
### **Download graphviz-2.38.msi and update your Path environment variable. Add C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.38\bin to User path and C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe to System Path. It's windows so you might need a reboot after updating that environment variable.**
### C:\Program Files \Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe
### **You have must installed the graphicviz uisng python package manager. Othewise, (.dot not execuatable in the system error faced)**
### pip install graphviz
